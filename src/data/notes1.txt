Measuring Success
--------------------
Success of a system may be measured by answering the following questions:
    Does the project solve what it was meant to solve?
    Is it easy to maintain and administer?
    Is it scalable to meet the needs of the client?
    Is there a successful support system in place for the client?
    Was it delivered on time and ready to go?
    Was the client happy with the finished product?

The Development Cycle
--------------------
Developing projects involves a process:
    Movie  - script and storyboard
    Science experiment – scientific method
    Construction – blueprint
    Software development – a plan (wait and see!)

The Waterfall Model consists of several phases: 
    Customer Request / Problem Statement
    Analysis 
    Design 
    Implementation 
    Integration /Test
    Maintenance 

*****Mistakes found early in the SDLC are much less expensive to correct than those found late.*****

The cost of developing software is not spread equally over the phases.  
The percentages shown are typical.
    Integration = 8%
    Implementation = 8%
    Design  = 8%
    Analysis = 8%
    Maintenance = 68%
